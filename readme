LEGO bricks are fun and popular with all age groups. Over the years sets have grown more complex with a greater number of pieces, different themes and a variety of colors available for players in the market. An analytical study with help of visualizations of this complex dataset provides players and data analysts worldwide a way to understand the trends in LEGOs. Our aim with this analytical research study is to analyze the sets produced each year, particularly the complexity and variations of colors and themes. Our results show that the number of sets has exponentially increased since the 1950s, with dramatic variations in colors and exponential growth in themes. We predicted the number of sets in coming years using linear regression. Further we plotted colors based on ten different themes and identified the unique colors overall.
